# Camp Island

An underwater volcano formed a new small island in the Pacific Ocean last month. All the conditions on the island seems perfect and it was decided to open it up for the general public to experience the pristine uncharted territory.
The island is big enough to host a single campsite so everybody is very excited to visit. In order to regulate the number of people on the island, it was decided to come up with an online web application to manage the reservations. 

## System Description

The system have to allow the following functionality:

- The campsite will be free for all
- The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days
- The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance
- Reservations can be canceled anytime

- Provide information of the availability of the campsite for a given date range with the default being 1 month.

To make a reservation the user will provide his/her email & full name at the time of reserving the campsite along with intended arrival date and departure date. Also, these reservation can be modified or deleted.

## Technologies

The application was built using Java with Spring Boot to expose REST methods. For persists the data, the system uses Hibernate and JPA, with a H2 database.

## Documentation

The REST API provides different endpoints (Table 1) to satisfy the above requirements, which are described below:

| Method | URL               | Brief description                                            |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | /reservation      | Creates a new reservation based in the required data         |
| GET    | /reservation      | Retrieve all reservations stored in the system within a date range passed as query parameters. |
| GET    | /reservation/{id} | Retrieve a reservation stored in the system associated at id parameter. |
| PATCH  | /reservation/{id} | Modify a reservation stored in the system associated at id parameter. It only allows to modify the arrival and departure dates. |
| DELETE | /reservation/{id} | Deletea reservation stored in the system associated at id parameter. |

*Table 1: summary of the REST API endpoints*

### POST

By a POST request, the user is able to create a new reservation into the system. In the system, a single reservation is represented with the same number of entities as the reservation days expressed in the request. For example, if a user wants to reserve the camp for three days until 2019-02-22 to 2019-02-25, into the system there will be three entities with one day duration each. One until 2019-02-22 to 2019-02-23, another to 2019-02-23 to 2019-02-24 and one last until 2019-02-24 to 2019-02-25.

The data required by the camp is sent into the body requests (`name`, `email`, `arrivalDate` and `departureDate`) in JSON format. 

The dates fields, will be in format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, and both the name and email are `'String'` fields. All the parameters are mandatory fields, so if one of them is missing the application will return an appropriate error message.
